# `decimal.js-tiny`

Fork of MikeMcl's [`decimal.js-light`][1], designed to carry a bundle with the smallest possible size.

Target platform is Node.js, other platforms aren't supported (yet?).

Note: `decimal.js-tiny` mirrors the version of incorporated `decimal.js-light`, therefore it **doesn't follow SemVer**.
